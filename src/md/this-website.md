### Making my own portfolio/blog website
Before making this website, my knowledge of web development extended only to plain JavaScript and HTML. 
So this was the project where I learned to use **React.js**, and where I continue to learn as I add new features to the site.

### Quirks
There are a couple of interesting details about this project. One is the use of **z-dog** to create the 3D folder models/animations. And the other is the changes I had to make to the standard create-react-app project in order to facilitate hosting with GitHub pages.
