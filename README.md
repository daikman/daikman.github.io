# Making my own portfolio/blog website
Before making this website, my knowledge of web development extended only to plain JavaScript and HTML. 
So this was the project where I learned to use **React.js**, and where I continue to learn as I add new features to the site.

I used the classic `create-react-app` template as a starter, and made a few changes to the app's configuration in order to facilitate hosting with GitHub pages. Another non-standard element of the website is the use of **z-dog** to create the 3D folder models/animations.
